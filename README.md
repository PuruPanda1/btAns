### Section A

1. **What is resolving power?**

Resolving power is the ability of an optical instrument, such as a microscope or telescope, to distinguish between two closely spaced objects. In microscopy, it refers to the capacity of a lens system to produce separate images of points that are close together. The resolving power of a microscope is often defined by the smallest distance between two points that can still be distinguished as separate entities.

Resolving power depends on the wavelength of light used and the numerical aperture of the lenses. The formula to calculate the resolving power is given by:
\[ d = \frac{\lambda}{2NA} \]
where \( d \) is the minimum distance between two points, \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light, and \( NA \) is the numerical aperture of the lens. The smaller the value of \( d \), the higher the resolving power.

2. **What are microbiostatic agents?**

Microbiostatic agents are substances that inhibit the growth and reproduction of microorganisms without necessarily killing them. These agents work by creating an environment that prevents microbes from multiplying, thus controlling the population and spread of potentially harmful organisms.

Examples of microbiostatic agents include certain antibiotics, disinfectants, and preservatives. For instance, tetracycline is a microbiostatic antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria, thereby preventing their growth. Unlike bactericidal agents, which kill bacteria, microbiostatic agents allow the immune system to eliminate the microbes.

3. **Define pasteurization.**

Pasteurization is a process of heat treatment used to kill or deactivate harmful microorganisms in food and beverages. Named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur, this technique involves heating the product to a specific temperature for a certain period and then rapidly cooling it.

There are different methods of pasteurization, including:
- **High-temperature short-time (HTST)**: Typically involves heating milk to 72°C for 15 seconds.
- **Ultra-high temperature (UHT)**: Involves heating milk to 135°C for 2-5 seconds, resulting in a product that can be stored without refrigeration.

The primary goal of pasteurization is to make food products safe for consumption and extend their shelf life without significantly affecting their nutritional value and taste.

4. **What is a synthetic media? Give an example.**

Synthetic media, also known as defined media, are culture media in which all chemical components are known and precisely measured. These media are used to grow specific microorganisms under controlled conditions, where the exact nutritional requirements are provided.

An example of synthetic media is **M9 medium**, which is commonly used for the growth of Escherichia coli. M9 medium contains:
- Glucose (as a carbon source)
- Ammonium chloride (as a nitrogen source)
- Magnesium sulfate
- Potassium phosphate
- Sodium chloride
- Water

The defined nature of synthetic media allows researchers to study the effects of specific nutrients on microbial growth and metabolism.

5. **Define IC50.**

IC50 stands for "half maximal inhibitory concentration." It is a measure used in pharmacology to indicate the concentration of a substance (such as a drug or an inhibitor) required to inhibit a specific biological or biochemical function by 50%.

The IC50 value is commonly used to assess the potency of a compound in inhibiting a particular target, such as an enzyme or receptor. It is determined through dose-response experiments and is expressed in molar concentration (e.g., µM, nM). A lower IC50 value indicates a more potent inhibitor.

6. **Name any two antiviral agents.**

Two antiviral agents are:
- **Acyclovir**: Used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).
- **Zidovudine (AZT)**: Used in the treatment of HIV infection. It inhibits the reverse transcriptase enzyme, preventing the replication of the virus.

### Section B

7. **Write a note on the working principle and applications of a spectrophotometer.**

A spectrophotometer is an analytical instrument used to measure the amount of light absorbed by a sample at different wavelengths. It operates on the principle of Beer-Lambert Law, which states that the absorbance of a sample is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species and the path length of the light through the sample.

The key components of a spectrophotometer include a light source, a monochromator (to select specific wavelengths of light), a sample holder, a detector, and a readout system. The light source emits a broad spectrum of light, which is then narrowed down to a specific wavelength by the monochromator. The selected light passes through the sample, and the detector measures the intensity of light before and after passing through the sample.

Applications of a spectrophotometer include:
- **Quantitative analysis**: Determining the concentration of a substance in a solution by measuring its absorbance at a specific wavelength.
- **Kinetics studies**: Monitoring the rate of reaction by measuring changes in absorbance over time.
- **Quality control**: Ensuring the consistency and purity of products in pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
- **Environmental testing**: Detecting and quantifying pollutants in water and air samples.

The versatility and accuracy of spectrophotometers make them essential tools in various scientific and industrial applications.

8. **What is Tyndallization? Write a brief note on its process.**

Tyndallization, also known as fractional sterilization, is a process of sterilizing liquids and other materials that are heat-sensitive. It involves repeated cycles of heating and incubation to kill both vegetative cells and spores of microorganisms.

The process of Tyndallization includes:
1. **Heating**: The material is heated to a temperature of 100°C for 15-30 minutes, which kills most vegetative cells.
2. **Incubation**: The material is then incubated at a favorable temperature for microbial growth (usually 37°C) for 24 hours, allowing any remaining spores to germinate into vegetative cells.
3. **Reheating**: The material is reheated to 100°C to kill the newly germinated vegetative cells.
4. **Repeating the cycle**: The heating and incubation steps are repeated for 3-4 cycles to ensure the destruction of all spores and vegetative cells.

Tyndallization is an effective method for sterilizing media, liquids, and other materials that cannot withstand the high temperatures of autoclaving. It is named after John Tyndall, who developed the technique in the 19th century.

9. **Define sterilization. Explain dry heat sterilization.**

Sterilization is the process of eliminating all forms of microbial life, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores, from a surface, medium, or product. It is essential in medical, laboratory, and industrial settings to prevent contamination and ensure the safety and efficacy of products.

Dry heat sterilization involves the use of high temperatures for an extended period to kill microorganisms. This method is typically employed for materials that can withstand high temperatures without damage, such as glassware, metal instruments, and powders.

The process of dry heat sterilization includes:
1. **Preheating**: The sterilizer is preheated to the desired temperature, usually between 160°C and 170°C.
2. **Loading**: The items to be sterilized are placed in the sterilizer, ensuring proper spacing for air circulation.
3. **Exposure**: The items are exposed to the high temperature for a specified time, typically 1-2 hours, depending on the temperature used.
4. **Cooling**: After the sterilization cycle is complete, the items are allowed to cool gradually before removal.

Dry heat sterilization kills microorganisms by denaturing their proteins and oxidizing their cellular components. It is an effective method for sterilizing heat-resistant materials and is often used as an alternative to moist heat (autoclaving) when necessary.

10. **Give a brief account on the principle of staining and its techniques.**

Staining is a technique used in microbiology to enhance the visibility of microorganisms and their structures under a microscope. The principle of staining involves applying colored dyes to the specimen, which bind to specific cellular components, providing contrast against the background.

There are several staining techniques, including:
- **Simple staining**: Uses a single dye (e.g., methylene blue) to color the entire cell, providing basic information about cell shape and arrangement.
- **Differential staining**: Uses multiple dyes to distinguish between different types of cells or structures. The most common differential stain is the Gram stain, which differentiates between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria based on their cell wall composition.
- **Special staining**: Targets specific cellular components or structures, such as endospores, capsules, or flagella. Examples include the endospore stain and the capsule stain.

The staining process typically involves the following steps:
1. **Fixation**: The specimen is fixed to the slide using heat or chemicals to preserve its structure and adhere it to the slide.
2. **Staining**: The stain is applied to the specimen and allowed to interact with cellular components.
3. **Washing**: Excess stain is washed off with water or alcohol to remove unbound dye.
4. **Observation**: The stained specimen is examined under a microscope.

Staining techniques are crucial in microbiology for identifying and characterizing microorganisms, studying their morphology, and diagnosing infections.

11. **Explain the method of maintenance and stocking of pure culture.**

Maintaining and stocking pure cultures is essential for preserving microbial strains for research, industrial, and clinical purposes. Pure cultures are maintained to ensure the availability of consistent and uncontaminated microorganisms.

Methods of maintaining and stocking pure cultures include:
- **Agar slants**: Microorganisms are streaked onto the surface

 of solidified agar in test tubes, which are then incubated and stored at low temperatures (4°C). This method is suitable for short-term storage.
- **Refrigeration**: Cultures can be stored in liquid media at low temperatures (4°C) to slow down their metabolic activity and prolong viability. This method is used for short- to medium-term storage.
- **Freezing**: Cultures are suspended in a cryoprotectant (e.g., glycerol) and stored at -20°C or -80°C. Freezing is effective for long-term storage, preserving cultures for several years.
- **Lyophilization (freeze-drying)**: Cultures are suspended in a protective medium, frozen, and then subjected to a vacuum to remove water by sublimation. The resulting dry powder is sealed in vials and can be stored at room temperature for extended periods.

Proper labeling and documentation are essential for maintaining and stocking pure cultures, including information on the strain, date of isolation, and storage conditions. Regular subculturing and viability checks are necessary to ensure the integrity and purity of the cultures.

12. **Discuss challenges in antimicrobial therapy. Add a note on MDR.**

Antimicrobial therapy faces several challenges that can affect its efficacy and outcomes. Some of the major challenges include:
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: The development of resistance by microorganisms to antimicrobial agents is a significant challenge. Resistance can arise through genetic mutations, horizontal gene transfer, and selective pressure from overuse and misuse of antibiotics.
- **Limited spectrum of activity**: Some antimicrobial agents have a narrow spectrum of activity, targeting only specific types of microorganisms. This limitation can reduce the effectiveness of treatment, especially in mixed infections.
- **Toxicity and side effects**: Antimicrobial agents can cause adverse reactions and side effects in patients, including allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, and organ toxicity. Balancing efficacy and safety is crucial in antimicrobial therapy.
- **Drug interactions**: Antimicrobial agents can interact with other medications, leading to reduced efficacy or increased toxicity. Managing drug interactions is essential for safe and effective therapy.
- **Biofilm formation**: Microorganisms can form biofilms on surfaces, which are resistant to antimicrobial agents and immune responses. Biofilms complicate the treatment of infections associated with medical devices and chronic wounds.

**Multidrug resistance (MDR)** is a critical concern in antimicrobial therapy. MDR refers to the ability of microorganisms to resist multiple classes of antimicrobial agents. MDR pathogens, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), pose significant challenges in clinical settings. Combating MDR requires a multifaceted approach, including the development of new antimicrobials, prudent use of existing agents, and infection control measures.

### Section C

13. **Explain the construction, working principle, and applications of SEM.**

14. **Give a detailed account on paper and thin layer chromatography.**

Paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography (TLC) are analytical techniques used to separate and identify components in a mixture. Both methods are based on the principle of adsorption and partitioning of compounds between a stationary phase and a mobile phase.

**Paper Chromatography**:
- **Principle**: The stationary phase is a sheet of cellulose paper, and the mobile phase is a solvent or solvent mixture.
- **Procedure**: A small spot of the sample is applied near the bottom of the paper. The paper is then placed in a container with the mobile phase, allowing the solvent to move up the paper by capillary action. As the solvent travels, it carries the sample components, which separate based on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases.
- **Detection**: The separated components form distinct spots on the paper, which can be visualized using UV light, iodine vapors, or specific staining reagents.

**Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)**:
- **Principle**: The stationary phase is a thin layer of adsorbent material (e.g., silica gel or alumina) coated on a glass, plastic, or aluminum plate. The mobile phase is a solvent or solvent mixture.
- **Procedure**: A small spot of the sample is applied near the bottom of the TLC plate. The plate is placed in a developing chamber with the mobile phase, allowing the solvent to move up the plate by capillary action. The sample components separate based on their interaction with the stationary phase and solubility in the mobile phase.
- **Detection**: The separated components form distinct spots on the TLC plate, which can be visualized using UV light, iodine vapors, or specific staining reagents.

**Applications**:
- **Qualitative analysis**: Identifying compounds in a mixture based on their retention factor (Rf) values.
- **Purity testing**: Assessing the purity of a substance by comparing its chromatographic profile to known standards.
